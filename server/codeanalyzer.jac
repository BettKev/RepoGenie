#server/agents/codeanalyzer.jac
#This agent is responsible for analyzing the code files received from the Repo Mapper.
#It generates detailed documentation for each file and interacts with the DocGenie agent to compile the final documentation set.

#Parse Python and Jac files.

#Build relationships between entities (e.g., which function calls which).

#Create and maintain a Jac graph representation of the codebase.

#Allow queries like “which functions call main()?”
